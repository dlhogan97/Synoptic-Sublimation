# East River Winter Wind Storms Characteristics and the Relationship to Seasonal Sublimation and Water Resources.

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for project focused on studying strong wind events within the East River valley, how often they occur, and their influence on sublimation and water resources within the river basin. This project is ongoing so check back for periodic updates!

## Analysis Steps

To replicate or build upon the research, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
`git clone https://github.com/dlhogan97/Synoptic-Sublimation.git`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
`.yml` file not yet created.
 <!--file to create an environment which will install all necessary dependencies for this analysis.-->

3. **Data Preparation:**
To be updated in the future.
<!--All data can be downloaded from [![DOI](zenodo.10056373.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/10056373)-->

4. **Run the Analysis:**
To be updated in the future.
<!--Navigate to the `notebooks` folder within `Upper_CO_Analysis`. A README is available within the `notebooks` folder to provide information about what each file is meant to do. Descriptions of each file are also available within the notebooks themselves. In summary, this folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each serving a specific purpose in the analysis and development of products related to the study of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), PRISM data, Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN), and associated investigations. Notebooks are categorized into numbered analysis files (e.g., `01_UCRB_exploratory_analysis_20230425.ipynb`) and development files (e.g., `dev_00_snowcourse_investigation.ipynb`). -->
