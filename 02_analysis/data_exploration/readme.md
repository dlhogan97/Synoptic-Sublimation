This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory analysis on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the `results` folder.

The `scripts` folder contains scripts needed to pull data from SAIL (may add functioanlity for pulling SPLASH data from ZENODO in the future.)
The `01_explore_valley_wind_events.ipynb` file starts to explore some of the valley wind events within the East River over the 2022 and 2023 winters using SAIL and SOS data, along with data from nearby meterological stations.
