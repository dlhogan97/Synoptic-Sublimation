    "## 1. What events had the highest percentile of wind speeds?\n",
    "We will begin to address this by looking at daily average wind speeds during the SAIL campaign. I'll define winter in this case as spanning the same periods as the SOS campaign for the 2023 winter (November 29 - May 7) and the period when at least 6\" of snow were on the ground per billy barr's measurement. This is going to include a storm that brought his site up from 1\" to 6\" because I want to include that storm and see how it influenced the season (not much I imagine). So the 2022 winter spans December 6 to May 1. The end is loosly defined as when snow melt rates really start to pick up. In 2022, between April 23-May 1 we lost 41 cm of snow. A similar thing happed in 2023 between April 29 and May 7. Could be more direct with this definition, but we'll start with that. Thus, with a shorter winter, we expect less sublimation to occur in the 2022 winter.\n",
    "To \n",
    "classify the top 90th percentile of windy days during the main snow season for 2022 and 2023. This may need to be broken down further to capture wind events, but we'll start with this. We'll begin by comparing the days for 3-20 m wind speeds and compare tower-to-tower to make sure we have consistency at our location.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We'll first make some box plots of daily average wind speeds at Gothic from SAIL, billy data, and 10m UW tower wind speed.\n",
    "2) We'll make a timeseries plot for each height bin and mark out the highest percentile of wind speeds for the year\n",
    "3) We'll then filter to the days with the highest 5% of wind speeds over each winter and see how they compare to each other.\n"
